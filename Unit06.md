**Unit 6: Cultural Exchange: Religion, Technology, and Art Along the
Silk Road** <span id="6"></span> 
*Although the Silk Road was mainly a vehicle for the exchange of silk
and other luxury goods, it also served as a venue for cultural
transmission, enabling the circulation of art, new technologies, and
religious beliefs.  For example, missionaries traveling from India along
the silk routes first introduced Buddhism to China.  Other missionaries
brought Manichaeism and Nestorian Christianity eastward; these religions
flourished in China and in the nomadic states of the Silk Road. 
However, the rise of Islam had a significant impact on these religions. 
In fact, the expansion of Islam influenced culture and trade across
Central Eurasia.  Islamic beliefs spread to the nomads of Central
Eurasia as Islamic merchants came to dominate the Silk Routes all the
way into China.  Major Islamic commercial settlements were located in
the Tang capital, Chang'an, and in the ports of Southeast China.  Over
time, Silk Road cities that had been dominated by Buddhism and faiths
such as Manichaeism and Nestorian Christianity were increasingly
centered around Islam.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will consider how religions from India, Syria, and
the Middle East were transmitted via the Silk Road and how Islam
supplanted many of these religions beginning in the seventh century.  We
will also study how technology and art often followed in the footsteps
of religious exchange.*
