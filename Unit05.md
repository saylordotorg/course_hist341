**Unit 5: The Silk Road During the Tang Dynasty** <span id="5"></span> 
*Under the Tang Dynasty in China, the Silk Road reached a pinnacle of
sophistication and profitability.  The relative peace and internal
division in China during Tang rule helped facilitate the Silk Road
trade.  Moreover, the rise of new powers in Central Eurasia (such as the
Uyghur Empire) encouraged the proliferation of commerce along the silk
routes.  The Sogdians dominated the East-West trade along the Silk Road
between the fourth and eighth centuries; they supplied many powerful
empires, including the Sassanids, Byzantium, and Tang China, with luxury
goods.  During this period, the Silk Road created an international web
of trade that increased political and cultural interaction and
transformed the nomadic cultures of Central Eurasia.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will study the increasingly important role of the
Silk Road in forging a relationship among the nomadic states of Central
Eurasia, China, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean.*
