**Unit 8: The Timurids, Mughals, and the Ming** <span id="8"></span> 
*After the collapse of the Mongol Empire, the Timurids rose to power in
the latter part of the fourteenth century.  Led by Tamerlane, the
Timurids established their capital at Samarakand, one of the great
cities of the Silk Road.  Through Silk Road commerce, Tamerlane and his
successors established diplomatic relations with Ming China.  By the
sixteenth century, the Mughal Empire, one of the great empires to occupy
Central Eurasia, had assumed control of much of the Silk Road.  While
some scholars have suggested that the Silk Road commercial system
collapsed with the disintegration of the Mongol Empire and the rise of
European maritime trade in the 1400s, overland trade continued to
flourish. *  
  
 *In this unit, we will consider how the great land-based empires of
Central Eurasia influenced the overland trade between the 1400s and
1600s. *
