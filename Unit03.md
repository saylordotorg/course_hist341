**Unit 3: Early Developments and the Silk Trade** <span id="3"></span> 
*There were several conditions that made the opening of the Silk Road
possible.  First, the domestication of pack animals—camels, horses, and
yaks—allowed for extended overland transportation.  Second, the nomadic
nature of the peoples of Central Eurasia allowed silk merchants to
travel across the continent without infringing upon borders or
settlements.  Third, the consumption of silk in the Middle East and the
Mediterranean spurred the expansion of the lucrative silk trade beyond
China.  Moreover, the efforts by the Han Chinese to develop trade
contacts with nomadic peoples to the west also opened the door to
commercial exchange in Central Eurasia.*  
 *   
 In this unit, we will study the environmental, cultural and political
conditions in Central Eurasia that laid the framework for the silk
trade.  In particular, we will consider the early trade networks created
by the Han Chinese and the Xiongnu, a nomadic confederation of Central
Eurasian tribes.*

    narrates Zhang Quian’s journey and describes his foreign relations
    activities.  While the Han Chinese had embraced a policy of
    tolerance toward their nomadic neighbors to the west, this approach
    changed under Emperor Wu-ti.  Wu-ti dispatched emissary Zhang Qian
    on a mission to Central Eurasia to explore the possibility of
    forging an alliance with nomadic states there.  Zhang Qian’s
    descriptions of the nomadic tribes—such as the “Description of
    Western Regions”—formed the basis of political and economic
    intelligence and stimulated the creation of the Silk Road.  This
