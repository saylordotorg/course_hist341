**Unit 9: European Traders and Explorers** <span id="9"></span> 
*Although the overland silk routes were lucrative trade networks,
Europeans, as avid consumers of silk and other Eurasian luxury goods,
were keen to establish a new silk route to the East.  In fact, when
Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic in 1492, he was looking
not for the Americas but for a new silk route to the Far East.  As a
result, Portuguese, Dutch, and English merchants sought to build an Asia
trading empire between the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries. 
Meanwhile, European missionaries, particularly the Jesuits, attempted
travel to China along the original silk routes.  The Russians, too,
sought to extend their influence in China; the “Siberian Road” linked
Siberia, China, and European Russia.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will consider how European traders and explorers
sought to create new silk routes between the Far East and Europe.  We
will examine the overland and maritime routes explored and exploited by
Europeans between the 1400s and the 1700s.*
