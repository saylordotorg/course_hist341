**Unit 4: Opening the Silk Road Between East and West** <span
id="4"></span> 
*The opening of the Silk Road between China and the Mediterranean was
driven by two major factors.  First, Han China sought to expand—and
profit from—its lucrative silk trade.  Second, both the Hellenistic and
Roman worlds created an enormous demand for silk.  The expansion of
Alexander the Great’s empire into Central Eurasia allowed the Greeks to
engage in the silk trade; many of the newly conquered lands had
important trade nodes along the Silk Road.  During the Han Dynasty,
Chinese emperor Wu Di established commercial relationships with
Ferghana, Bactria, and the Parthian Empire—all nomadic peoples who
played central roles in the rise of the Silk Road.  This new trade
spurred a “silk craze” throughout the Roman Empire as well as the
dispatch of Roman envoys to China.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will study the expansionist impulses of Han China,
the Romans, and the Greeks—all of whom garnered territory in Central
Eurasia along the Silk Road.  In fact, as we will see, the silk trade
played a significant role in the territorial expansion of these powers.*
