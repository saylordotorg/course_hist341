**Unit 1: World Systems and Civilizations: The Significance of Central
Eurasia** <span id="1"></span> 
*Central Eurasia encompasses a vast swath of arid land that is
ill-suited for farming and far removed from coastal ports.  As a result,
the earliest communities to emerge in Central Eurasia—around 4500
B.C.E.—were nomadic.  These migrant tribes were primarily herders,
although a few tribes did engage in agricultural practices.  Nomads’
lives centered on the horse—used for both meat and transportation—and
were shaped by frequent military campaigns.  When the Chinese opened the
Silk Road in the second century, many nomadic tribes, particularly the
Sogdians of the Fergana Valley, benefited by trading with silk merchants
and raiding caravans.  In short, the opening of the Silk Road
transformed the lives of the nomadic steppe peoples by introducing a new
commercial system and by forging a link between Eurasia and the
Mediterranean world.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will examine the emergence of the earliest nomadic
peoples in Central Eurasia.  We will then study how the rise of silk
production in China and the opening of the Silk Road influenced the
nomads of Central Eurasia.*
