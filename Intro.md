This course will introduce you to the history of Central Eurasia and the
Silk Road from 4500 B.C.E to the nineteenth century.  You will learn
about the culture of the nomadic peoples of Central Eurasia as well as
the development of the Silk Road.  The course will be structured
chronologically; each unit will focus on one aspect of the Silk Road
during a specific time period.  Each unit will include representative
primary- and secondary-source documents that illustrate important
overarching political, economic, and social themes, such as the
discovery and production of silk in China, diplomatic relations between
Han China and nomadic peoples of the Eurasian steppe, the international
scope of the Silk Road trade routes, European interest in finding a “new
silk route” to China, and the “Great Game” between China, Russia, and
Great Britain in Central Eurasia in the nineteenth century.  By the end
of the course, you will understand how the Silk Road influenced the
development of nomadic societies in Central Eurasia as well as powerful
empires in China, the Middle East, and Europe.

### Course Information

Welcome to HIST341. Below, please find some general information on the
course and its requirements  
    
 **Course Designer:** Christa Dierksheide and [Professor Concepcion
Saenz-Cambra](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-o-t/#ProfessorConcepcionSaenzCambra)  
    
 **Primary Resources: **This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following resources from these main websites:

-   University of Washington: Professor Daniel C. Waugh’s “[The Silk
    Road: Materials for an
    e-History](http://faculty.washington.edu/dwaugh/srehist.html)”
-   University of Washington’s “[Art of the Silk
    Road](http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/exhibit/index.shtml)”
    Exhibit

Several articles are authored by Dr. Daniel C. Waugh, Professor at the
Department of History and Jackson School of International Studies,
University of Washington.  The “Art of the Silk Road” exhibit was
organized as part of “Silk Road Seattle,” a collaborative public
education project sponsored by the Walter Chapin Simpson Center for the
Humanities at the University of Washington.  
    
 **Requirements for Completion**: In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam. 
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the resources for each unit of this course.  
  
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment**: This course should take you a total of **94.5
hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists
the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These
should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a
look at these time advisories and to determine how much time you have
over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions**: This course covers a great deal of history and a
large part of the globe so take your time with the material.  Please
also read carefully the introductions to each unit as well as the
information in the instruction boxes: these show how the material under
review fits together and will help you connect one section of the course
to the next.  As in many history courses in the Saylor program, it is
important that you have a good grasp of the material in each section
before moving on to the next, as later coursework is often designed to
build upon the knowledge obtained in previous assignments.  It may help
to take notes as you work through the course materials, which will be a
useful reference as you prepare to study for the Final Exam.
