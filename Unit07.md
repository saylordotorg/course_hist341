**Unit 7: The Silk Road in the Age of the Mongols** <span
id="7"></span> 
*The Mongols—nomads of central Eurasia—dominated world history during
the thirteenth century.  The Mongols invaded many postclassical empires
and built an extensive cultural and commercial network.  Led by Chinggis
Khan and his successors, the Mongols brought China, Persia, Tibet,
Eurasia Minor, and southern Russia under their control.  The Mongol
empire also opened trade routes—primarily along the Silk Road—as well as
lines of communication between different regions in Eurasia.  *  
  
 *In this unit, we will see how the Mongols presented a formidable
nomadic challenge to sedentary, civilized societies throughout Eurasia. 
We will also study how they unified the nomadic peoples of the Eurasian
steppe and brought about an era of political peace and stability that
bolstered the Silk Road trade.*
