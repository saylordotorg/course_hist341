**Unit 2: Defining the Silk Road** <span id="2"></span> 
*The Silk Road was a series of interconnected trade routes linking all
parts of Eurasia with China, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean
World.  The route first emerged during the Han Dynasty in China, when
merchants expanded the lucrative Chinese silk trade westward.  The Silk
Road, however, was comprised of a number of routes.  A first, the
Northern Route, began in the Chinese city of Chang’an and pushed
westward through central Eurasia and Persia.  A second, the Southern
Route, ran through India and ended in the Levant.  And a maritime route
originated at the mouth of the Red River (present-day Hanoi), looped
around southeast Eurasia and the Indian subcontinent, and ended at the
Red Sea and Persian Gulf.  Luxury goods such as silk brocade, porcelain,
frankincense, sandalwood, and glass were traded along these routes.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will study the geography of the Silk Road and the
many routes connecting East Asia, Central Eurasia, and the
Mediterranean.  We will also consider the many cultures involved in this
extensive trade network.*
