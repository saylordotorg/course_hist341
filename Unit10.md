**Unit 10: The Silk Road and the "Great Game"** <span id="10"></span> 
*During the nineteenth century, European powers, particularly Britain
and Russia, began to vie for control of Central Eurasia.  In the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, many European traders had
established commercial outposts in China, India and the East Indies with
the intent of opening a new silk route.  But in the 1800s, European
nations began to use military and economic force to ply their way into
Central Eurasian markets and territories.  Both Russia and Britain
exploited the weaknesses and turmoil of Qing China and the nomadic
states to gain access to territories and trade in Central Eurasia.  As
Russia began to expand southward, Britain feared that it might encroach
on its imperial holdings in India. A century-long conflict ensued for
power over Central Eurasia—this Anglo-Russian conflict was known as the
“Great Game.”*  
  
 *In this unit, we will consider the implications of the Anglo-Russian
conflict on the nomadic peoples in Central Eurasia. *
